# CS408 Computer Networks (Spring 2024-2025)

This repository contains my homework assignments and project work for **Computer Networks** at Sabancƒ± University.  
The course provides an in-depth exploration of modern computer networking concepts, protocols, and architectures, from low-level data transmission to high-level transport mechanisms.  
The repository includes both theoretical exercises and practical implementations or simulations that demonstrate key networking principles.

## üéØ Course Description

The Computer Networks course covers fundamental and advanced topics required to understand and analyze computer networks.  
It provides a comprehensive study of protocols, network architectures, and mechanisms used in today's Internet and local networks.  
Hands-on assignments and a course project reinforce these concepts through implementation, configuration, and simulation.
